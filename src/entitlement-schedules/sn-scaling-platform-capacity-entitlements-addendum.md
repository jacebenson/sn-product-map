1. Scaling Platform Capacity
Customers in the Shared Environment (also commonly known as Multi-Tenant Environment) that
have entitled included instances are able to increase their minimum entitled platform storage
capacity as Customer's Annual Contract Value (ACV) grows with ServiceNow. For the purposes
of determining the minimum entitled platform storage capacity only, Customer’s ACV is
calculated as the total of the annual subscription fees of all Subscription Products subscribed by
Customer, either directly with ServiceNow or through an Authorized Reseller, at an account level.
Where some or all of Customer’s subscription is purchased through Authorized Reseller, for the
purposes of determining the minimum entitled platform storage capacity, the ACV is the total of
the annual subscription fees to be paid by Customer to ServiceNow and/or from Authorized
Reseller to ServiceNow for all Subscription Products subscribed by Customer, at an account level
(i.e., not the amount paid by Customer to Authorized Reseller for such Subscription Products).
The minimum entitled platform storage capacity for various account ACV ranges can be found
in the table below. Customer’s minimum entitled platform storage capacity is determined based
on Customer’s ACV and will scale (upward or downward) based on changes to Customer’s ACV
at any given time.
Customer will be entitled to additional platform storage capacity if the aggregated amount of
entitled individual instance storage capacity across Customer’s included instances is less than
Customer’s total minimum entitled platform storage capacity, as provided below in Table 1. The
amount of additional platform storage capacity is calculated as the difference between: (1) the
aggregated amount of entitled individual instance storage capacity, and (2) Customer’s total
minimum entitled platform storage capacity. The additional platform storage capacity may be
used for offsetting any included instance’s storage capacity overages.

Table 1: Total minimum entitled platform storage capacity
*Account ACV refers to the ACV per unique customer account. For customers with multiple accounts,
each account will have separate Minimum Entitled Included capacity values as determined by the
account’s ACV.
**Minimum Entitled Included capacity is the total storage capacity the customer is entitled to, which
includes the sum of all included instances storage capacity (e.g. New customer gets a 1x2TB production
instance and a 1x2TB non-production instance for a total of 4TB included capacity).

Please Note: Storage capacity of each of Customer’s instance (production or non-production)
cannot be pooled across other instances.
