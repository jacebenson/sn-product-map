1. Workflow Data Fabric
Workflow Data Fabric (WDF) is a unified framework from ServiceNow that empowers customers
to connect, understand, and act on data across their enterprise with real-time intelligence.

2. Data Fabric Credits
Data Fabric Credits are the standard unit of consumption across Workflow Data Fabric. Each
action or usage event— such as executing an RPA bot, making an API call, or transferring data
— consumes a predefined number of Data Fabric Credits. Customers purchase credits in units
called Packs. Credit consumption is based on actual usage, allowing flexible, value-based
pricing that scales with your organization’s needs.
The table in Section 2.1 outlines the capabilities, usage descriptions (i.e., actions), meters, and
corresponding Data Fabric Credits consumed.
