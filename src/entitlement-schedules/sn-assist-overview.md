1. Now Assist
Now Assist refers to generative AI-powered experiences on the Now Platform. With Now Assist,
you can improve productivity and efficiency in your organization with better self-service, faster
answers and recommended actions, and empower users to search more effectively.

2. Assist
An “assist” is a unit used to measure usage of Now Assist skills via performed skill actions. The total
available number of assists for Customer is defined by Customer’s contract and pooled at the
account level. Users of Now Assist will generate an assist(s) when they execute a given Now Assist
skill either as a single skill action, or through the combination of multiple skill actions. All use of Now
Assist skills will consume assists (even if the user does not have a licensed seat). A list of skills, skill
actions, and the number of assists counted are set forth in section 2.1.
